{\large \textbf{9.10.1 Prediction of wet sulfate deposition}}

\vspace{.3cm}

We continue with our analysis in Section 8.8.3 of the clean wet sulfate deposition data in the conterminous U.S.  Our ultimate goal will be to create a map, with prediction intervals, on a grid across the whole U.S. that will help us assess the spatial patterns in wet sulfate deposition, and our confidence in those predictions.  We left some model selection choices open from Section 8.8.3 because predictive ability of those models will help in our selection process.  We will complete the analysis here.

LOOCV eliminates one datum at a time, using all of the rest of the data to predict the one that was removed.  There is a fast and a slow way to do this.  The slow way is to remove a datum and then re-estimate all of the parameters using ML or REML estimation each time.  However, with the removal of but a single datum, the parameter estimates change very little.  A fast way to achieve LOOCV is based on holding all parameters at their values as estimated by using all of the data, and then using results from partitioned matrices so that we only have to invert the covariance matrix once (which can be saved from the ML or REML estimation, so there is in fact no additional inverses required.  Note that if a matrix is partitioned as,
$$
    \bSigma = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
       {\bSigma}_{11} & {\bSigma}_{12} \\
       {\bSigma}_{21} & {\bSigma}_{22}
    \end{bmatrix},
$$
then 
$$
    \bSigma\upi = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
       \bSigma_{11}\upi + \bSigma_{11}\upi\bSigma_{12}\bS\upi\bSigma_{21}\bSigma_{11}\upi & -\bSigma_{11}\upi\bSigma_{12}\bS\upi \\
       -\bS\upi\bSigma_{21}\bSigma_{11}\upi & \bS\upi
    \end{bmatrix},
$$
where $\bS= \bSigma_{11} - \bSigma_{12}\bSigma_{22}\upi\bSigma_{21}$ is known as the Schur complement of block $\bSigma_{22}$ of matrix $\bSigma$.  Now write $\bSigma \upi$ in block form as
$$
    \bSigma \upi = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \tilde{\bSigma}_{11} & \tilde{\bSigma}_{12} \\
        \tilde{\bSigma}_{21} & \tilde{\bSigma}_{22}
    \end{bmatrix},
$$
where the dimensions of the blocks in $\bSigma \upi$ follow those from the dimensions of $\bSigma$. Note that the inverse of $\bSigma_{11}\upi$ can be obtained from $\bSigma \upi$ by
$$
    \bSigma_{11} \upi = \tilde{\bSigma}_{11} - \tilde{\bSigma}_{12} \tilde{\bSigma}_{22} \upi \tilde{\bSigma}_{21}.
$$
Moreover, let us order the data such that the datum to be removed is last, so that $\bS$ is a scalar, then the inverse of $\bS$ is trivial and $\bSigma_{11} \upi$ can be computed rapidly. The main computational expense of kriging predictions rely on the inverse covariance matrix for the observed data, but in LOOCV that is given by $\bSigma_{11} \upi$, which is computed rapidly if we already have $\bSigma \upi$. 

LOOCV results for the clean wet sulfate deposition data are presented in Figure~\ref{Fig:SO4_LOOCV}.
