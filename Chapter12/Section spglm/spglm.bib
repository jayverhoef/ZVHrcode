	abstract = {There have been many attempts in recent years to map incidence and mortality from diseases such as cancer. Such maps usually display either relative rates in each district, as measured by a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) or some similar index, or the statistical significance level for a test of the difference between the rates in that district and elsewhere. Neither of these approaches is fully satisfactory and we propose a new approach using empirical Bayes estimation. The resulting estimators represent a weighted compromise between the SMR, the overall mean relative rate, and a local mean of the relative rate in nearby areas. The compromise solution depends on the reliability of each individual SMR and on estimates of the overall amount of dispersion of relative rates over different districts.},

	abstract = {Estimation and prediction in generalized linear mixed models are often hampered by intractable high dimensional integrals. This paper provides a framework to solve this intractability, using asymptotic expansions when the number of random effects is large. To that end, we ﬁrst derive a modiﬁed Laplace approximation when the number of random effects is increasing at a lower rate than the sample size. Second, we propose an approximate likelihood method based on the asymptotic expansion of the log-likelihood using the modiﬁed Laplace approximation which is maximized using a quasiNewton algorithm. Finally, we deﬁne the second order plug-in predictive density based on a similar expansion to the plug-in predictive density and show that it is a normal density. Our simulations show that in comparison to other approximations, our method has better performance. Our methods are readily applied to non-Gaussian spatial data and as an example, the analysis of the rhizoctonia root rot data is presented.},

	abstract = {To define a likelihood we have to specify the form of distribution of the observations, but to define a quasi-likelihood function we need only specify a relation between the mean and variance of the observations and the quasi-likelihood can then be used for estimation. For a one-parameter exponential family the log likelihood is the same as the quasi-likelihood and it follows that assuming a one-parameter exponential family is the weakest sort of distributional assumption that can be made. The Gauss-Newton method for calculating nonlinear least squares estimates generalizes easily to deal with maximum quasi-likelihood estimates, and a rearrangement of this produces a generalization of the method described by Nelder \& Wedderburn (1972).},
