_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     This function creates a vector of ‘n’ equally spaced colors along
     the selected color map.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     viridis(n, alpha = 1, begin = 0, end = 1, direction = 1, option = "D")
     
     viridisMap(n = 256, alpha = 1, begin = 0, end = 1, direction = 1, option = "D")

     plasma(n, alpha = 1, begin = 0, end = 1, direction = 1)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       n: The number of colors (>= 1) to be in the palette.

   alpha: The alpha transparency, a number in [0,1], see argument alpha
          in ‘hsv’.

   begin: The (corrected) hue in [0,1] at which the color map begins.

     end: The (corrected) hue in [0,1] at which the color map ends.

direction: Sets the order of colors in the scale. If 1, the default,
          colors are ordered from darkest to lightest. If -1, the order
          of colors is reversed.

  option: A character string indicating the color map option to use.
          Eight options are available:

            • "magma" (or "A")

            • "inferno" (or "B")

            • "plasma" (or "C")

            • "viridis" (or "D")

            • "cividis" (or "E")

            • "rocket" (or "F")

            • "mako" (or "G")

            • "turbo" (or "H")

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     ‘magma()’, ‘plasma()’, ‘inferno()’, ‘cividis()’, ‘rocket()’,
     ‘mako()’, and ‘turbo()’ are convenience functions for the other
     color map options, which are useful when the scale must be passed
     as a function name.

     Semi-transparent colors (0 < alpha < 1) are supported only on some
     devices: see ‘rgb’.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     ‘viridis’ returns a character vector, ‘cv’, of color hex codes.
     This can be used either to create a user-defined color palette for
     subsequent graphics by ‘palette(cv)’, a ‘col =’ specification in
     graphics functions or in ‘par’.

     ‘viridisMap’ returns a ‘n’ lines data frame containing the red
     (‘R’), green (‘G’), blue (‘B’) and alpha (‘alpha’) channels of ‘n’
     equally spaced colors along the selected color map.  ‘n = 256’ by
     default.
